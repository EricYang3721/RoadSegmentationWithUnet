0. subtract mean from training and testing (use preprocessing function)
(done)1. add loss logger: epoch, iterations
(done) 2. train with different loss functions(cross entropy, dice)
3. train with different unet architectures: 
    different starting feature channl dimensons(32, 64)
    different downsampling layers
4. use or not use batchnorm
5. train with or without data augmentation
6. Try image shift, fill_mode = 'constant', cval=0.0
